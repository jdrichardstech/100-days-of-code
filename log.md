# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: Tuesday, 6/6/17

**Today's Progress**: Completed the egghead.io series 'How To Contribute to Open Source' by Kent C. Dodds.
Forked, made pull request, added a checkPalindrome function to repository and had pull accepted by Kent.

**Thoughts**: Pretty smooth overall. Not used to complying to constraints setup by an open source repository. So was interesting when certain tests were failing with ESLint and I had to comply to the requirements. Wasn't difficult just new. All in all my merge worked and there were no merge conflicts.

**Link(s) to work**:
