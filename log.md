# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: Tuesday, 6/6/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Completed the egghead.io series 'How To Contribute to Open Source' by Kent C. Dodds.
Forked, made pull request, added a checkPalindrome function to repository and had pull accepted by Kent.
* Worked on React Native Tutorial with Redux.

**Thoughts**:
* using github to make small contribute to another repository went pretty smooth overall. Not used to complying to constraints setup by an open source repository. So was interesting when certain tests were failing with ESLint and I had to comply to the requirements. Wasn't difficult just new. All in all my merge worked and there were no merge conflicts.
* React Native is going a bit slower. Want to work more with it and have a few small apps in mind.

### Day 1: Wednesday, 6/7/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Refactored the architecture of the React Native Tutorial I followed yesterday in order to see if I could apply another architecture with which I am familiar.
* Worked on React Native Tutorial with Redux.
* Can definitely notice the similarities between React Native and Swift even though I only visited Swift for about a month.
* tried chunkyArray algorithm on freecodecamp. failed. will try tomorrow
* went back...solved it [chunkyMonkey solution](http://repl.it/Ib2w/1)
* solved freecodecamp algorithm [slackerFish](http://repl.it/languages/javascript)

**Thoughts**:
* Couldn't get all of the refactor to work and had to find a middle ground
* Using a lot more ES6. Interesting how it simplifies copying and changing state with mutating state directly. Still want to build a Node backend using ES6. Another goal.
* Want to work on own React Native project after finishing tutorial to so how much I learned and retained. Like I did with my [My Amazon](http://github.com/jdrichardstech/MyAmazon)
* Thought process. Doing things on purpose not guessing. Think before coding. Continue to work on this.
