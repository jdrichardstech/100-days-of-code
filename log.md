# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: Tuesday, 6/6/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Completed the egghead.io series 'How To Contribute to Open Source' by Kent C. Dodds.
Forked, made pull request, added a checkPalindrome function to repository and had pull accepted by Kent.
* Worked on React Native Tutorial with Redux.

**Thoughts**:
* using github to make small contribute to another repository went pretty smooth overall. Not used to complying to constraints setup by an open source repository. So was interesting when certain tests were failing with ESLint and I had to comply to the requirements. Wasn't difficult just new. All in all my merge worked and there were no merge conflicts.
* React Native is going a bit slower. Want to work more with it and have a few small apps in mind.

### Day 1: Wednesday, 6/7/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Refactored the architecture of the React Native Tutorial I followed yesterday in order to see if I could apply another architecture with which I am familiar.
* Worked on React Native Tutorial with Redux.
* Can definitely notice the similarities between React Native and Swift even though I only visited Swift for about a month.
* tried chunkyArray algorithm on freecodecamp. failed. will try tomorrow
* went back...solved it [chunkyMonkey solution](http://repl.it/Ib2w/1)
* solved freecodecamp algorithm [slackerFish](http://repl.it/languages/javascript)

**Thoughts**:
* Couldn't get all of the refactor to work and had to find a middle ground
* Using a lot more ES6. Interesting how it simplifies copying and changing state with mutating state directly. Still want to build a Node backend using ES6. Another goal.
* Want to work on own React Native project after finishing tutorial to so how much I learned and retained. Like I did with my [My Amazon](http://github.com/jdrichardstech/MyAmazon)
* Thought process. Doing things on purpose not guessing. Think before coding. Continue to work on this.

### Day 1: Thursday, 6/8/17
**Today's Progress**:
* Github hell!
* I have two accounts and spent quite some time trying to figure out how to push to either account. Generated ssh keys, edited configure file to no avail only to find out that I had to delete my github in the mac keychain. After that, when I push to my github account it simply asks for my username/email and password. Not a fan of keychain. I want to find a way to bypass it.
* Finished first tutorial on React Native and starting an advanced tutorial. Just downloaded Exponent to my mac & iPhone and am excited to see how the workflow goes with that. Evidently, Exponent allows one to immediately view as well as share the current app you are working on. Also, by using an actual device, things like animations become less jittery and more like real world flow.
* Spent the morning going over the code I had followed yesterday. I still have to get used to destructuring in React and ES6. It is sometimes hard for me to track. But it is definitely cleaner code.

**Thoughts**:
* need to learn more about react-native-router-flux and react-native-communications
* Received an invite to Chingu and have to consider whether I am going to take that on this month along with this. Have to investigate a bit more.

### Day 2: Friday, 6/9/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Beginning the day learning and reviewing data structures and algorithms. Specifically hash tables, linked lists and binary search trees.
* Read a solid article on constructor functions [CSS-Tricks: Understanding Javascript Constructors](http://css-tricks.com/understanding-javascript-constructors/)
* Practiced writing by hand algorithm code.
* Did some of the javascript FCC lessons
* Solved the [Mutations Basic Algorithm](http://repl.it/If4s/0)

**Thoughts**:
Still considered joining the Honey Badger Chingu. A bit intimidating but will help with accountability and focus I hope.

### Day 3: Saturday, 6/10/17

**Today's Progress**:
* Signed up for the HoneyBadger Chingu
* Working on Tutorial for Codepen.io to understand the interface since I haven't really used it.
* After researching Boolean Objects solved [Falsy Bouncer](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/falsy-bouncer)
